## CSV Web Application

### Goal
Design a full stack web application to handle CSV data.

### Purpose
The assignment is very open by design, the intent is to give you an opportunity to showcase your skills and demonstrate techniques you like to use.

### Estimated duration
3-6 hours, however there is no min/max duration

### Requirements
The application should have the ability to:
- [ ] The application should be comprised of both a frontend and a backend
- [ ] Upload a CSV file
- [ ] List uploaded CSV files
- [ ] Download the previously uploaded CSV file
- [ ] Display the CSV content showing at least all column headers and content
- [ ] Provide statistics on the number of people with the same year in the “date” field
- [ ] The frontend **MUST** have at least _three buttons_, allowing for upload, download and date statistics

### Notes
   * The application can be written in any language
   * The CSV will be comma delimited
   * **The CSV file may contain empty string in the ‘state’ column. In this case, fill in with the text “BLANK” instead**
   * The application should be able to run on any machine
   * We do not impose restrictions on what technology stack you wish to use, however the technical stack we use is python backend framework and JS frontend framework
